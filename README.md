# TripPlanner
I've started more projects to never be finished.
learning c++ from a Test driven develpoment approach

oh, this tripplanner is just a brute force shorest vector calculator for Space Engineers GPS
it was going to be in c# but VScode gave compiler/library errors and i'm kinda sick of faffing with .net on linux
when i have so many existing compilers preinstalled
